# Welcome to My GitHub Repo ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! This is my very first GitHub repository.  
I'm just getting started with version control, Git, and GitHub.

## About This Repo

This repository currently doesn't contain any project filesâ€”just this README to mark the beginning of my coding journey.

Stay tuned for future projects, experiments, and ideas!

## Why This Exists

- To learn how Git and GitHub work
- To document my progress as I grow as a developer
- To have a space for testing and trying new things
